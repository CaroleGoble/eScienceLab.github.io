#caGrid Project

[caGrid](http://www.cagrid.org/) is part of [caBIG](http://cabig.cancer.gov/) (cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid), a US project to carry out eScience and bioinformatics in cancer research.

The myGrid team were funded by the US National Cancer Institute ([NCI](http://www.cancer.gov/)) to help caGrid integrate Taverna and caGrid, so that [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/) can find and use (secured) caBIG services.

The team wrapped a selection of typical non-caBIG services used by Taverna users so that they are annotated and comply with caBIG’s compatability requirements.

The work on the caGrid Project follows on from caGrid’s previous adoption of [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/).

The [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2008.120) “Combining the Power of Taverna and caGrid: Scientific Workflows that Enable Web-Scale Collaboration” has been written by Wei Tan, Ian Foster and Ravi Madduri.
