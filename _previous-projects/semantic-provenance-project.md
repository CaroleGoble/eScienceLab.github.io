#Semantic Provenance Project

The Semantic Provenance Project was an [Eli Lilly](http://www.lilly.com/) funded project. It added value to Eli Lilly’s Lilly Science Grid (LSG)
by integrating functionality from Indiana University’s provenance system Karma and the University of Manchester’s S-OGSA system
that allows the description, storage and retrieval of various types of annotations.
