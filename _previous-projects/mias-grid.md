#MIASGrid

The MIAS project examined the requirements of Medical Imaging and Signals.
The MIASGrid sub-project, took examples of those requirements and investigated how e-Science and the myGrid tools in particular could satisfy them.
The project was funded by the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/) for Â£494k and ran until April 2006.

The project produced several workflows that demonstrated the applicability of Taverna to the handling of large amounts of medical image data. The workflows made use of [MATLAB](http://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and also with users.

The workflows covered two domains:

* The analysis of MRI scans of knees to detect changes in cartilage
* The of a database of mammograms
