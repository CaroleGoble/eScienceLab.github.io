The Apache Taverna (incubating) team has announced the release of
[Apache Taverna Server 3.1.0-incubating](https://s.apache.org/taverna-server-3.1.0).

[Apache Taverna](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/) is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute data-driven workflows.

Apache Taverna Server enables a dedicated server for remotely executing Taverna workflows, exposed as REST Web APIs and WSDL Web Services. This enables integration of Taverna workflows into web portals, mobile applications, as well as allowing desktop users to execute remotely on local server or cloud infrastructure. Taverna Server can be configured for POSIX user isolation (e.g. sudo) and can restrict which workflows to execute.

Taverna Server runs workflows defined with Apache Taverna Language in SCUFL2 format (`.wfbundle`). It can also execute many Taverna 2 workflows (`.t2flow`), depending on which activities they require.
 
For details, see [Taverna Server downloads](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/server/) and [documentation](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/documentation/server/3.1/).

## Disclaimer

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at [The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org/) sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
