Jeffrey M. Perkel at Nature Magazine has published a Toolbox Article [Workflow systems turn raw data into scientific knowledge](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-02619-z)

The article describes "how workflow tools can make your computational methods portable, maintainable, reproducible and shareable". CWL and containers are examined as core workflow tools.
