The [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/") project has joined the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

The eScience Lab have [participated in the Common Workflow Language project](/activities/cwl/) since its early days. CWL started out from the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/)'s [BOSC conference](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC) as an informal collaboration between workflow system developers, and the eScience Lab have supported CWL's growth into an independent project in its own right with an increasing uptake by the bioinformatics community.

We believe this transition, to become a self-governed project formally part of a legal entity with charity status, will mean that the Common Workflow Language project can progress further in its goal for independent community development and vendor-independent workflow interoperability.

The press release below was [originally posted](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2018/apr/11/cwl-new-member-project/) by Software Freedom Conservancy:

<p>Software Freedom Conservancy welcomes the <a href="http://www.commonwl.org/">Common Workflow Language  (CWL) project</a> as Conservancy's newest member project.  The project develops and maintains a specification for describing data analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software and hardware environments, as well as a supporting reference implementation.</p> 

<p>The Common Workflow Language project follows the <a href="https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/">OpenStand principles for collaborative open standards development</a> to openly evolve the 
 <a href="https://w3id.org/cwl/">CWL specifications</a>, which have already been <a href="https://www.commonwl.org/#Implementations">implemented</a> by a large number of independent vendors and open source projects. 
 CWL has seen a large uptake by researchers, in particular in the bioinformatics community, with more than <a href="https://view.commonwl.org/workflows">700 public CWL workflows</a> developed across academia and industry.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The CWL project also maintains the <a href="https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool">cwltool</a> reference implementation, <a href="http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/">documentation</a>, 
<a href="http://www.commonwl.org/#Software_for_working_with_CWL">CWL tooling and libraries</a>, as well as facilitating interactions and collaborations within the wider CWL community and related external activities. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Conservancy</a>, a public charity focused on ethical technology, is the home of over <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/">forty projects</a> dedicated to developing free and open source software.  Conservancy acts as a corporate umbrella, allowing member projects to operate as charitable initiatives without having to independently manage their own corporate structure and administrative services.
</p>

<blockquote>
"CWL is solving important problems that will make collaborating on big data analysis easier," 
said <cite>Karen M. Sandler, Conservancy's Executive Director</cite>.  
"We're excited to have the Common Workflow Language project join Conservancy."
