[BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/), the leading European _Centre of Excellence_ for Computational Biomolecular Research, was established in 2015 with support from the [European H2020 program for developing research infrastructures](https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020-EU.1.4.1.).

The excellent execution of all the centre’s activities since its foundation has enabled us to secure a new round of larger funding for another three years of operation until end of 2021 under the project [BioExcel-2](https://doi.org/10.3030/823830). 

Here we present a summary of the future plans for upcoming activities at the centre!

## Driving Computational Biomolecular Research

Based on the successes of the first phase of the project, BioExcel is continuing its mission to advance science and technology in the life sciences by:

* pushing the **performance**, **efficiency**, **scalability**, and **usability** of several key [software packages](https://bioexcel.eu/software/) on high-end compute systems, including exascale – [GROMACS](https://bioexcel.eu/software/gromacs/), [HADDOCK](https://bioexcel.eu/software/haddock/), [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/), [PMX](https://bioexcel.eu/software/pmx/); extensive co-design activities with HPC vendors and system developers
* improving the **usability** of existing applications and tools to support the convergence of _high-performance computing_ (HPC), _high-throughput computing_ (HTC), and _high-performance data analytics_ (HPDA) via the development of **[workflows](https://bioexcel.eu/software/workflows/**) combining HPC simulations with data management and analytics;
* significantly expanding the range of [training](https://bioexcel.eu/services/training/), commercial applications and [services](https://bioexcel.eu/services/) that are offered;
* making [publications](https://bioexcel.eu/category/publications/), [webinars](https://bioexcel.eu/category/webinar/), [libraries](https://bioexcel.eu/research/projects/biobb_standardization/), workflows, [codes](https://bioexcel.eu/software/code-repositories/), and training material developed by BioExcel available via open-source and open-access principles;
* making BioExcel **sustainable** so researchers in academia and industry can rely on having access to BioExcel’s resources in the long term; and
* **[collaborating](https://bioexcel.eu/community/collaborations/)** with international initiatives, such as other centres of excellence, to strengthen the links between related research communities and leverage worldwide expertise

We will continue active engagement with **industry**. Business-friendly [licensing](https://bioexcel.eu/software/licenses/) of the core applications allows for their commercial reuse and linking. For example, the codes are already used by all of the top ten pharmaceutical companies as well as a number of SMEs. The centre will also offer tailored _training_ to industry researchers by arrangement.

We encourage academic and industrial researchers to [get in touch](https://bioexcel.eu/contact/) and learn about the many opportunities that we offer for support, joint activities, and collaborations. BioExcel has [representatives](https://bioexcel.eu/about/partners/) in Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Malta, Spain, Finland and the UK who are happy to provide guidance and assistance with your work.

## eScience lab in BioExcel-2

The [eScience Lab](/) is [part of BioExcel](/projects/bioexcel/), representing the University of Manchester, with a particular focus on workflows, repoducibility and usability.

In the BioExcel-2 project we are deputy lead of Work Package 2 _Convergence of HPC/HPDA and Improved Usability_; and task lead of 
T2.6 _Retaining usability, interoperability and reproducibility in Exascale workflows_ and 
T3.4 _Standards and Best Practice_ (task lead).

We will be building on our extensive experience and engagement with [Common Workflow Language](/activities/cwl/) and [Research Objects](/products/researchobject/) as well as fostering links between BioExcel communities and related [projects](/projects/) like [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/).
