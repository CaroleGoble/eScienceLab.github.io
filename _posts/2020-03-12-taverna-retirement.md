In 2020 the Taverna community
[voted](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r559e0dd047103414fbf48a6ce1bac2e17e67504c546300f2751c067c%40%3Cdev.taverna.apache.org%3E)
to **retire** Taverna as a project and withdraw the code base from the Apache Software Foundation.

The Taverna 3.x code base remains available under the Apache License 2.0, but is now simply called
_Taverna_ rather than ~~Apache Taverna (incubating)~~.


After retirement the code repository and website is being moved from
Apache's infrastructure to the 
[taverna GitHub organisation](https://github.com/taverna); although 
the code base is no longer actively maintained, pull requests
may infrequently be considered by remaining volunteer caretakers.
