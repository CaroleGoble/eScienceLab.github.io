The researchobject.org community recommendation [RO-Crate 1.0](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0) has been released.

**RO-Crate** (Research Object Crate) specifies a method of organizing file-based data with associated metadata, using LinkedData principles, in both human and machine readable formats, with the ability to include additional domain-specific metadata.

The core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD file, the RO-Crate Metadata File, named `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld`. This file contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole (the Root Data Entity) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment.

While providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, the recommendation document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.

## Building community consensus

RO-Crate is a fresh initiative, bringing together data archive and repository maintainers with existing Research Object, workflow and provenance communities.  Starting as a small cross-domain group, organically formed to build the core principles and first sketches of their use, we are now expanding to collect use cases and reaching out to other packaging initiatives to build common ground.

One emerging use of RO-Crate is for capturing workflows and tools in a federated [workflow repository](https://github.com/eosc-life/tools-collaboratory-roadmap being built in [EOSC-Life](http://www.eosc-life.eu/), a large European Open Science Cloud project across 13 research infrastructures in the life science domain. However RO-Crate is also aiming to be usable by individual data scientists with no particular infrastructure beyond [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), who may not have the time or motivation to use a cascade of metadata vocabularies and research data management tools.

RO-Crate development and discussion is done openly in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate) by volunteers, with monthly telcons to synchronize the effort. Anyone can [join](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/1) to help form the RO-Crate approach.
