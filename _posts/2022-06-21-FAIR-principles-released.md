The FAIR4RS Working Group Steering Committee are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0 of the FAIR Principles for Research Software 
(FAIR4RS Principles), after about 2 years of work by over 500 people.

This work has been organized by the FAIR4RS Working Group, which was jointly convened by the Research Data Alliance (RDA), 
the Research Software Alliance (ReSA), and FORCE11. Similar to the [FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), 
the goal of the FAIR4RS Principles is to improve the sharing and reuse of research software, by making it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. 
These principles are needed because specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and 
versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the FAIR data principles.

The FAIR4RS Principles themselves, as well as explanation about them, are available as:
