We are pleased to announce a new version of the [SEEK Platform](/products/seek/) – [version 1.10.2](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-1102)

This version includes a few bug fixes since the previous release in July, and in particular it fixes a validation problem with linking to Publications that were added before describing Publication types were available, and do not have a specific type defined.
