The paper [Uniform resolution of compact identifiers for biomedical data](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.29) have been published, with eScienceLab's [Niall Beard](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-0231) and [Nick Juty](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2036-8350) on the author list.

[![Scientific Data: Uniform resolution of compact identifiers for biomedical data](/images/compact-identifiers-paper.png)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.29)

The _Scientific Data_ article describes the [joint effort](https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/identifiersorg-n2tnet) by [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/) to harmonize the compact identifier resolver services [identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org) and [N2T.net](https://n2t.net/). The collaborative work was done under the umbrella of [Force11](https://www.force11.org/) and the [ELIXIR Implementation Study on Data Identification and Interoperability](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/data-identification) to provide machine-resolvable persistent identifiers for datasets across a wide range of biomedical data repositories.

In the accompanying [editorial](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.95) the journal is committing to improve data citations using these services:

> _Scientific Data_ is changing the way we incorporate links into our data citations. We will now be taking advantage of the resolver services offered by [identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org) and [N2T.net](https://n2t.net/) to provide more standardized and predictable links for biomedical datasets that have accession identifiers when they are cited in our publications.

Nick Juty from The University of Manchester's eScience Lab is quoted in the [ELIXIR's announcement](https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/identifiersorg-n2tnet):

> All entries in Identifiers.org are carefully curated to a high standard, collating all the necessary information to unambiguously and accurately identify individual data records. This is a continuous process, requiring the addition of new resources, whilst maintaining and updating existing records.
