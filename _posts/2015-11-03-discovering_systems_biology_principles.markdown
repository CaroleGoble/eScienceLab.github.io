A large part of systems biology is concerned with studying how the molecular networks inside living cells function. In parallel, mathematical models help systems biologists to figure it out. Offered by the VU University in Amsterdam, this 1-week course serves as an introduction to mathematical modeling as it is used in systems biology. The course does not require any introductory reading or courses, it should be accessible to students with diverse backgrounds.
