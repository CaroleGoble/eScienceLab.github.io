The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) has officially published the beta release of the [Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python course](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/) on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6532057#.Ynkb4dPMKX0). 
This release is now ready to be taught by other instructors from The Carpentries community or anyone with the relevant expertise.

The lesson teaches intermediate-level software development skills in a way that mimics a typical software development process in a team, 
starting from an existing piece of software. It continues from the material covered in the novice-level Software Carpentry lessons and follows 
the same teaching principles, as described in Best Practices for Scientific Computing and Good enough practices in scientific computing.

The lesson is using the official [Carpentries lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/) and is [hosted at The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/).
