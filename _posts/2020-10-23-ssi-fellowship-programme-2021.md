Applications for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)'s [Fellowship Programme 2021](http://bit.ly/ssi-fellows2021) open on Monday 7 December 2020. [Sign up here](http://eepurl.com/dvOJB5) for updates and to be notified when registration opens.

The Fellowship Programme provides funding for individuals who want to improve how research software is done in their domains and/or area of work. Being a Fellow also helps individuals develop skills and knowledge in their area of software sustainability, empowers them to speak about issues and network with like-minded individuals from a wide variety of research areas.

Each Fellow will be allocated £3,000 to spend over 15 months beginning 1 May 2021. The funding is flexible to support activities that are beneficial to both the Fellow and the Institute. For example, the funding can be used to:

- attend conferences
- setup and run workshops
- organise software sustainability sessions at domain conferences
- nurture or contribute to communities of practice
- collaborate with other Fellows
- host, organise or teach training events, such as through the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)

In light of the ongoing situation around COVID-19, we encourage applicants to consider that travel and in-person events may not always be feasible, and we particularly welcome plans with online-based activities.

Fellows are drawn from a wide range of areas, experience and career stages. Visit our [Fellows’ profiles](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows) to read more about those awarded Fellowships in previous years and have a look at some of our [Fellows’ blog posts](https://software.ac.uk/tags/fellows) for examples of funded activities.
