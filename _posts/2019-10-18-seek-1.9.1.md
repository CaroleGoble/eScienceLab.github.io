We are pleased to announce a new version of the [SEEK Platform](/products/seek/) – [version 1.9.1](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-191)

Along with a number of minor bugfixes, the version includes:

  * Minor User Interface improvements
      * More consistent sorting of lists.
      * Consistent Add New button to add new items linked to the current item. This replaces buttons that only appeared in
      some places - such as the "Add New Data File" for "Assay".
      * Split Edit and Manage actions between 2 separate pages, rather than being handled through the same form.
  * Initial support for [bioschemas.org](https://bioschemas.org) / [schema.org](https://schema.org) JSON-LD markup
    * Supporting Project, Taxon, Sample, Event, DataSet, DataCatalogue, DigitalDocument, and PresentationDigitalDocument.
  * Validating assay and technology type URI's (particularly when submitting through the API).
  * Managing project members through the API.
  * Fix to an problem and inconsistency with how countries and the country codes are stored and displayed.
