We are pleased to announce, as an outcome of the [FAIRDOM](/projects/fairdom/) project, the publication of a journal article
in [Molecular Systems Biology](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110387) about
the [COVID-19 Disease Map project](https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190).

It describes a large-scale community effort to build an open access, interoperable and computable repository of COVID-19
molecular mechanisms, an approach that hopes to deal with future waves of COVID-19 or similar pandemics longer term.

[FAIRDOMHub](/fairdomhub) was a key element of the data sharing and communication infrastructure, and the COVID-19 Disease Map project
provided valuable feedback and use-cases that helped improve the [FAIRDOM-SEEK platform](/products/seek/).

The full article is Open Access and can be found
at [https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110387](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202110387)
