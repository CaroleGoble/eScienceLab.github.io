We are pleased to announce a new version of the [FAIRDOM-SEEK Platform](/products/seek/) – [version 1.12.1](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-1121)

This is a small bugfix release, which includes a security fix so updating is recommended.

Other changes include:

* An overhaul and refresh of Gatekeeper behaviour, fixing bugs and allowing repeat requests to be sent following a previous rejection.
* Fix to an error when interacting with the Ontology Lookup Service API, which affected creating and using sample types and controlled vocabularies in some cases.
* More tolerant URL checking when registering a remote asset.
* Removed option to generate a DOI for a hidden version.

Details on installing SEEK can be found in our Documentation, at [https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html](https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html) – including running with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
