The project _Industrial Biotechnology Innovation and Synthetic Biology Accelerator_ ([IBISBA 1.0](projects/ibisba/)) 
has been funded for 3 years as part of [H2020 INFRAIA-02-2017](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/infraia-02-2017.html). The IBISBA project launched in December 2017.

The overarching aim of IBISBA 1.0 is to support and accelerate the uptake of **industrial biotechnology** as a key enabling technology for advanced manufacturing, providing a distributed network of _research infrastructure facilities_  (e.g. for synthetic biology) and _ICT platform_ for workflows and data management.

The eScience Lab is partnered with the Manchester Synthetic Biology Centre ([SynBioChem](http://www.esciencelab.org.uk/projects/synbiochem)), both of which contribute several person years of effort to the IBISBA project.
