We are pleased to announce a new version of the [SEEK Platform](/products/seek/) – [version 1.10.0](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-1100)

* Filtered search and browsing
* Enhanced support for publications
* Adding one or more Discussion Channel links to all Assets
* A “Request Contact” button for Assets, to allow a registered user to initiate an email discussion with the owner and creators of that item.
* Increased zoom level when previewing model images, and ability to view the original in its full resolution
* Support for ‘include’ when using the JSON API
* Renaming of contributor to submitter – to be clearer about what this attribute represents
