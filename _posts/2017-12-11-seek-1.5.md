We are pleased to announce the release of [SEEK version 1.5](http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-150).

[SEEK](http://seek4science.org/) is the software behind the [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org) repository and many others communities, in particular in systems biology.

Some highlights

* Our first released version of our [JSON API](http://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/api.html). This has been built to conform to the JSON API specification, and is documented on SwaggerHub. This read API has been developed in conjuction with, and feeds into, a write API which will be released incrementally in subsequent releases.
* Incorporating the new [JERM 2](http://jermontology.org/) ontology, along with updates and extensions to the RDF produced by SEEK.
* **DOIâ€™s and ORCiD identifiers** are now displayed clearly in various views and lists.

More details about this release can be found in the [SEEK release notes]([SEEK version 1.5](http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/#version-150).
