myGrid highlighted as UK EPSRC Pioneer

On page 56 of the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Pioneer report, Lesley Thompson, Director of Science and Engineering, at the EPSRC says myGrid “underpins most bioinformatics research in the UK, and also illustrates the value of the physical and engineering sciences to all of the health and life sciences.”

> "MyGrid’s widespread use across the country clearly justifies its description as part of the UK’s scientific e-infrastructure – a resource hundreds of teams resort to – to support their research."﻿
