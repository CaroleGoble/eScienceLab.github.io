[Force 11](https://www.force11.org/group/eg2/BostonJuneWorkshop) hosted a harmonization workshop in Harvard, MA on Thursday 2nd June 2016, involving participants from BD2K and [ELIXIR Excelerate](http://www.esciencelab.org.uk/projects/excelerate/) projects. The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to harmonize the transatlantic efforts in identifier resolution systems. Both the US based resolution system ([Name-2-Thing](http://n2t.net)) and its European counterpart ([identifiers.org](http://identifiers.org)) both ostensibly serve the same function. Each of these Identifier Resolution Services associates data providers to a list of URI patterns through which individual identifiers can be resolved. The precise approach adopted however, differs; for example, while Name-2-thing uses prefixes, Identifiers.org uses namespaces.  Harmonization efforts centred on utilising a shared list of assigned prefixes, to be used by both IRSs. 

The ability to retrieve key information directly from data providers, sufficient to allow the semi-automated population of the prefix registry was also debated. It was decided that this could be encoded directly within schema.org markup, which could also serve as a template with which to generate alternative versions, if required (for example .txt files).
 
The meeting was full of other interesting conversations,  around encapsulating information on the preferred (primary or alternative) resolvers for an identifier, and conditions for the use of landing page services.
