[Research Object Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) has released the specification [RO-Crate 0.2](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/0.2).

RO-Crate is a _community effort_ to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on [schema.org](https://schema.org/) annotations in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description _accessible_ and _practical_ for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.

The [specification](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/0.2) defines a method, known as _RO-Crate_ (Research Object Crate), of organizing file-based data with associated metadata, using **Linked Data** principles, in both human and machine readable formats, with the ability to include additional domain-specific metadata.

The core of RO-Crate is a **JSON-LD** file, the _RO-Crate Metadata File_, named `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld`. This file contains **structured metadata** about the dataset as a whole (the _Root Data Entity_) and, optionally, about some or all of its files. This provides a simple way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment.

While providing the **formal specification** for RO-Crate, the document also aims to be a **practical guide** for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research **data packages**, with explanation by examples.

RO-Crate development and discussion is done openly in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate) by volunteers from a range of institutions across multiple academic domains, with monthly telcons to synchronize the effort. Anyone can [join](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/1) to help form the RO-Crate approach. The RO-Crate activity is chaired by Eoghan Ó Carragáin from University College Cork, Peter Sefton from University Technology Sydney, and Stian Soiland-Reyes from the eScience Lab at The University of Manchester.
