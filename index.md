The [eScience team][eSt] have produced and continue to develop a suite of [products][prod] designed to “help e-Scientists get on with science and get on with scientists”. The tools support the creation of e-laboratories and have been used in domains as diverse as systems biology, social science, music, astronomy, multimedia and chemistry. The tools have been adopted by a large number of projects and institutions.
