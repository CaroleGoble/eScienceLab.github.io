The [eScience Lab](/about/) research group is led by [Professor Carole Goble](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Carole.goble/).
The group is based at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/),
[University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk).
It's affiliated with the wider [Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/).

The [eScience Lab team](/people/) are focused on research and development around a set of tools designed for data driven
and computational research. The tools support the coming together of people, data and methods in a particular research area;
this is also know as an _e-laboratory_. These e-Laboratories or _e-Labs_ support domains as diverse as systems biology,
social science, music, astronomy, multimedia and chemistry.
The [tools](/products/) have been adopted by a large number of projects and institutions.

Our [research](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) span a wide array of topics, including eScience, bioinformatics,
biodiversity, scholarly communication, reproducible science, linked data, provenance, community building and knowledge representation.
