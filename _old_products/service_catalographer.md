ServiceCatalographer was an open-source Web-based platform for describing, annotating, searching and monitoring REST and SOAP Web services. Service providers and institutions could use it to curate and publicise their Web services. Scientists could use its powerful search capabilities for locating the services they need to help them with their scientific research and work. ServiceCatalographer could monitor availability and reliability of services over time to provide users with suggestions as to which services are the most reliable.

ServiceCatalographer was based on the software originally developed as part of the [BioCatalogue project](/projects/biocatalogue), which provided a curated catalogue of life science Web services. It was written in Ruby on Rails.
