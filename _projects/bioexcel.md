[BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/) is a **Centre of Excellence for Biomolecular
Research**, initially funded for three years by the [EC Horizon
2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/news/eight-new-centres-excellence-computing-applications)
program for e-Infrastructure, and refunded for another three years.

The centre facilitate the use of _high-performance computing_ (HPC) and _high-throughput computing_ (HTC) in
biomolecular research, both in academia and industry.

The BioExcel project aims to improve the performance, efficiency, scalability
and accessibility of software for biomolecular modelling (in particular
[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/), [HADDOCK](http://haddocking.org/) and 
[CPMD](http://www.cpmd.org/)), allowing such tools to be scaled up to run on
larger supercomputer systems, while also making them easier for biomolecular
researchers to use on computational infrastructures by providing training and
guidance on best practices and integration with commonly used 
[workflow systems](https://bioexcel.eu/software/workflows/)
such as 
[CWL](/activities/cwl/), 
[KNIME](https://www.knime.org/), 
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/), 
[Apache Taverna](/products/taverna/) or 
[COMPSs](http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/grid-computing/comp-superscalar).

As a Centre of Excellence, BioExcel gathers biomolecular consultants with
experience in both HPC/HTC and the life sciences, who can assist both academic
and industrial researchers with using and improving tools for computational
biomolecular research.

## eScience Lab contributions

The eScience Lab contributes to BioExcel's 
[workflow](http://bioexcel.eu/software/workflows/) support, in particular for 
the work packages:



 * _WP2: Portable Environments for Computing and Data Resources_ - integrating
   biomolecular tools with scientific workflow systems, improving deployment
   with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)) and [CWL](/activities/cwl/)
 * _WP3: Consultancy & User Groups_ - engaging user community, training and
   documentation, hosting the 
   [Workflows interest group](http://bioexcel.eu/community/interest-groups/workflows-ig/) and
   [webinars]()

We developed the [CWL Viewer](/products/cwlviewer/) with support from BioExcel.

In addition we provide BioExcel with valuable [collaborations](https://bioexcel.eu/community/collaborations/) with our links to  [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/), [Common Workflow Language](/activities/cwl/), [EOSC](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud) and [Open PHACTS](/projects/openphacts/).
