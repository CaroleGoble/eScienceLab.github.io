SysMO-DB created a web-based platform, and tooling, for finding, sharing and exchanging Data, Models and Processes in Systems Biology.
It was designed to support the SysMO Consortium(Systems Biology for Micro-Organisms), but the principles and methods employed are equally applicable to other multi-site Systems Biology projects.

The main objectives of SysMO-DB were to: facilitate the web-based exchange of data between research groups within- and inter- consortia,
and to provide an integrated platform for the dissemination of the results of the SysMO projects to the scientific community.
We aimed to devise a progressive and scalable solution to the data management needs of the SysMO initiative, that:

* facilitates and maximises the potential for data exchange between SysMO research groups;
* maximises the ‘shelf life’ and utility of data generated by SysMO;
* provides an integrated platform for the dissemination of the results of the SysMO projects to the scientific community; and
* facilitates standardisation of practices in Systems Biology for the interfacing of modelling and experimentation.

SysMO-DB had a second round of funding - [SysMO-DB2](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/research/grants-search/AwardDetails/?FundingReference=BB%2fI004637%2f1) - that ran from November 2010 until November 2014 .

The success of SysMO-DB eventually lead to the formation and funding of [FAIRDOM](/projects/fairdom)
