#ComparaGrid

[ComparaGrid](http://www.comparagrid.org/) was a [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) funded project to develop a prototype system to capture the details of relationships between genomic data
either within or across species thus enabling complex ad hoc queries to be run. ComparaGrid demonstrates that the underlying raw data
can be combined to draw maximum benefit from those data for all genomic communities.

Its partners were the [Roslin Institute](http://www.roslin.ac.uk/) (A Law PI),
the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/), [University of Newcastle](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/) , the [European Bioinformatics Institute](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/),
the [Institute of Food Research Centre](http://www.ifr.ac.uk/) and the [John Innes Centre](http://www.jic.ac.uk/).

ComparaGrid ran from January 2005 to June 2008.
