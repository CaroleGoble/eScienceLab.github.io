[CORBEL](http://www.corbel-project.eu) is an initiative of eleven new biological and medical research
infrastructures (BMS RIs), which together will create a platform for
harmonised user access to biological and medical technologies,
biological samples and data services required by cutting-edge
biomedical research. CORBEL will boost the efficiency, productivity
and impact of European biomedical research.

The eScience Lab team are part of CORBEL's [WP6](http://www.corbel-project.eu/work-packages.html) for Data access,
management and integration

CORBEL receives funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654248.
