#ONDEX

[ONDEX](http://ondex.sourceforge.net/) is currently an opensource suite of software that “enables data from diverse biological data sets to be linked, integrated and visualised”.
This [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) funded [project](http://www.ondex.org/index.shtml) aims to support ONDEX and its integration with more general bioinformatics tools, such as those developed by the myGrid team.
The existing ONDEX functionality is being exposed as webservices.
These may then be used in workflow systems such as [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/). Taverna workflows are also used to increase the functionality of ONDEX.

The partners are the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) , [University of Newcastle](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/), [Rothamsted Research](http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/) ([C Rawlings](http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/people/rawlingc)),
the [National Centre for Text Mining](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/) and [Manchester Centre of Integrative Systems Biology](http://www.mcisb.org/).


The project runs from April 2008 to March 2011
