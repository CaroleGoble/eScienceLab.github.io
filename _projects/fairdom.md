FAIRDOM is a joint action of ERA-Net
[ERASysAPP](http://fair-dom.org/erasysapp) and European Research
Infrastructure [ISBE](http://project.isbe.eu/) to establish a data and
model management service facility for Systems Biology.  Our prime
mission is to support researchers, students, trainers, funders and
publishers by enabling Systems Biology projects to make their Data,
Operating procedures and Models, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable
and Reusable (FAIR).
