The CHIP-SET project](http://web.archive.org/web/20151024060946/http://www.farrinstitute.org/centre/HeRC/67_EInfrastructure.html) was part of the [Farr Institute of Health
Informatics Research](http://www.farrinstitute.org) e-infrastructure working group].

CHIP-SET aimed to extend the electronic laboratory (e-Lab) concept and software to
bring investigators together in a secure on-line environment. The
software would codify methodology making it easier to use data through
semantic technologies. By consolidating the best of research and
existing data warehouses into a single coherent role and embedding
methodology it would create distributed sense making of data available
maximising its usability.

Users would be able to create sharable snapshots of the collaboration space
that include detailed metadata about individual content and the
relationships between content. These snapshots were managed as
[Research Object Bundles](/products/researchobject/) and provide
an important mechanism for aggregating, identifying and annotating
sharable content.
