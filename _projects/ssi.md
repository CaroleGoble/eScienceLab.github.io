# SSI

The Software Sustainability Institute was founded to support the UK’s
research software community - a community that includes the majority
of UK’s researchers.

Its mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research
software to enable world-class research (better software, better
research).

The four institutions in the consortium – Edinburgh, Southampton,
Manchester, Oxford – represent over 25 years of collaboration on
software for research with unparalleled software engineering
expertise.
