This Project will coordinate and upscale DNA barcoding and genome sequencing of biodiversity in Europe to enhance understanding of biodiversity and biodiversity declines and develop synergies by aligning the efforts and resources of the DNA barcoding and genome sequencing communities. The Project is organised around two major Streams of work, focusing on DNA barcoding (iBOL) and Genome Sequencing (EBP), led by BIOSCAN Europe and ERGA respectively. The Work Package and management structure of the Project are a matrix structure of the DNA barcoding and the Genome Sequencing Streams, with Pillars representing steps of a value chain that addresses the needs of these two Streams.
Streams focus on creating a value chain connecting the delivery work packages. The work packages (WPs) for the DNA barcoding Stream are: WP2, WP4, WP6, WP8, WP10. The WPs for the Genome Sequencing Stream are WP3, WP5, WP7, WP9, WP11. A third Stream (WP12) is formed at the interface of the two networks and delivers work that represents the joint investments and shared resources needed for the Project implementation and the science at the interface of DNA barcoding and genome sequencing. This is the WP UNIMAN is involved in.

Pillars form the five areas of work of the Project (node development, sampling, sequencing, data, applications). Pillars include WPs that contribute to the steps in the delivery chain of across the two networks. Connectivity in the vertical axis is essential in terms of coordinating innovation and capacity building activities


## eScienceLab contributions

UK partners in Horizon Europe projects are funded through [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) (#10040409) from the [UKRI Horizon Europe guarantee](https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/apply-for-horizon-europe-guarantee-funding/).


Contributions include Bringing RO-Crate to COPO in WP12, and to cross-walk to FAIR-IMPACT and BioDT.

The joint work is focused on priority areas in biodiversity research, training, and conservation where current challenges are recognised and there are clear needs for well-aligned developments that will accelerate future work. 

Task T12.5 will build on genomics (meta)data management systems of the Darwin Tree of Life, iBOL, ELIXIR and other infrastructures, services, and interoperability resources to provide a comprehensive FAIR data foundation. It will support ERGA and BIOSCAN Europe workflows in an integrated framework using the COPO data brokering platform to support the processing, validation, and ingestion of standardised sample, barcode and sequencing metadata into the biodiversity genomics data ecosystem.
