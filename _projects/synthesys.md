SYNTHESYS+ is a pan-European collections infrastructure project and the
fourth iteration of the SYNTHESYS programme, funded by the European
Commission. SYNTHESYS+ will commence on 1 February 2019 and run until 31 January 2023. 

SYNTHESYS+ is the final iteration of the programme, which builds upon
previous SYNTHESYS projects which ran from February 2004 – July 2009;
September 2009 – August 2013; and September 2013 - August 2017. All iterations
of the SYNTHESYS programme have developed collections infrastructure with
international partners, via discrete work packages coordinated under
deliverables of Access, Networking, and Joint Research Activities. 

SYNTHESYS+ will lay the foundations for the [Distributed System of Scientific
Collections](https://dissco.eu/) (DiSSCO), a massive scientific infrastructure project, which will
see 115 European Museums from 21 Countries position their collections  at the
centre of data-driven scientific excellence and innovation in environmental
research, climate change, food security, one health and the bioeconomy.
