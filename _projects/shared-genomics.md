#Shared Genomics

This project in partnership with [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) aims to develop accessible High Power Computing infrastructure to support the analysis of large genetic data. An essential part of the work is the integration of results with metadata retrieved from knowledge repositories.
This work will build upon the myGrid achievements in the association of metadata with data and the description of the semantics of services.
The project is based at the North West Institute for BioHealth Informatics ([NIBHI](http://www.nibhi.org.uk/)), a collaborative venture between the major universities in the North West of England,
industrial partners such as [Astra Zeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), and the [North West Development Agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Regional_Development_Agency). The principal investigator is .

The project is funded for Â£600k and runs from March 2008 to February 2010.

##Enable Taverna workflows in a Shared Genomics causality workbench

This is an [ENGAGE](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/projects/engage/) funded project to enable [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/) workflows using Shared Genomics services to be called in a more efficient manner. This work builds on the .
