#HELIO

HELIO, the Heliophysics Integrated Observatory, was a three year EU funded project and started in June 2009.

>The Heliophysics Integrated Observatory, HELIO, will deploy a distributed network of services that will
>address the needs of a broad community of researchers in heliophysics. HELIO will provide the most
>comprehensive integrated information system in this domain; it will coordinate access to the resources
>needed by the community, and will provide access to services to mine and analyze the data.

The project [partners](http://www.helio-vo.eu/aboutus/helio_consortium.php) included institutions from France, ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the UK and the USA.

The project used [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/) as the mechanism for running its workflows.
