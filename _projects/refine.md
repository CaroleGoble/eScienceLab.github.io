#REFINE

[REFINE](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/), Tools for the text mining-based visualisation of the provenance of biochemical networks, is a [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) funded project
to find solutions for the terminology problem in systems biology, by developing techniques for recognising synonym terms.
The REFINE project involves the use of text mining tools. Their application will be influenced by the experience of the myGrid team and users in this area.
The principal investigator is [Sophia Ananiadou](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/), Director of the National Centre for Text Mining ([NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/))
at the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

The project runs from January 2007 to June 2010.
