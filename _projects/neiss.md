The [National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/projects/neiss/about.php) was a [JISC-funded project](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140702233839/http://jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/einf/neiss) to undertake a coordinated programme of productionising services and
furthering uptake through community engagement to create a sustainable, long-term platform for social simulation with potential for major strategic impact,
both in the UK and internationally. The project involved [Leeds University](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/),
[Manchester University](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) (including [NCeSS](http://www.ncess.ac.uk/)), [Stirling University](http://www.stir.ac.uk/), [Glasgow University](http://www.glasgow.ac.uk/),
[UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/), [Southampton University](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/), [STFC Daresbury Laboratory](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/about-us/where-we-work/daresbury-laboratory/)

Within the project, the eScienceLab team were working on:

* the integration of Taverna functionality into a Portal, i.e., providing JSR 168/286 compliant components that provide access to enactment, management, monitoring and creation of workflows;
* the re-purposing of services from myExperiment, facilitating their integration into a portal. An important focus will be the incorporation of social networking functionality to provide extended archiving and documentation capability for social simulations
