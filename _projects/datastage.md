The NHLBI's [DataSTAGE](https://www.nhlbidatastage.org/) project will develop innovative computing solutions that meet the needs of the NHLBI and our research community, building on the cloud-based infrastructure of the [NIH Data Commons](https://commonfund.nih.gov/commons), which [kicked off in 2018](http://www.researchobject.org/2017-12-commonspilot/). NHLBI's DataSTAGE is a cloud-based platform, or technical framework, for tools, applications, and workflows. DataSTAGE provides secure workspaces to share, store, cross-link, and compute large sets of data generated from biomedical and behavioral research.

## FAIR4CURES

[Seven Bridges Genomics](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) and the [Elsevier Mendeley Data](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/mendeley-data-platform) team collaborate in the DataSTAGE project in _Team Xenon_ to continue development of [FAIR4Cures](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/anitawaard/cni-2018-a-research-object-authoring-tool-for-the-data-commons), which was [initiated](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/science-and-technology/elsevier-and-seven-bridges-receive-nih-data-commons-grant-for-biomedical-data-analysis) as a [NIH Data Commons pilot](https://commonfund.nih.gov/commons) in the [Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC)](https://public.nihdatacommons.us/) and now carried forward as part of DataSTAGE.

FAIR4Cures aims to build a FAIR genomics workflow execution and data management solution. The core components are:

* [Common Workflow Language](/activities/cwl/) for interoperable definitions of the computational workflows
* [Seven Bridges Platform](https://www.sevenbridges.com/platform/) for executing scalable workflows
* [Research Object](/products/researchobject/) for packaging the result dataset including executed worklow as [BDBags](http://bd2k.ini.usc.edu/tools/bdbag/)
* [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/) for archiving/publishing the research objects
* [GUID Broker](https://public.nihdatacommons.us/DCPPC-DRAFT-8_KC2/) for assigning and resolving permanent identifiers of workflows, datasets and research objects, using DOIs and MinIDs

## eScience Lab contribution

eScience Lab is a subcontractor to Mendeley Data to develop the [Research Object Composer](https://github.com/ResearchObject/research-object-composer)
