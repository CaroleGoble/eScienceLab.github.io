e-Fungi was a [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) funded project to produce an e-Science infrastructure for comparative functional genomics in fungal species.
Parts of the e-Fungi project include the development of a data warehouse and analysis libraries that are exposed as webservices.
These webservices can be used within the for the creation of workflows.

The principal investigators were Professor Paton, Professor Oliver, Dr Rattray and Dr Hubbard of the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

The project ran from October 2004 to June 2008.
