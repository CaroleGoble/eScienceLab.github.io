#SageCite

[SageCite](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/projects/sagecite/) is a JISC funded project to develop and test a Citation Framework linking data, methods and publications.
The project has international links with the [Concept Web Alliance](http://conceptweblog.wordpress.com/) and [Bio2RDF](http://bio2rdf.org/). The partners are [UKOLN](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/),
the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/) (representing [DataCite](http://datacite.org/)),
with contributions from [Nature Genetics and PLOS](http://www.nature.com/ng/index.html).

The project will work through a number of workpackages comprising:

* Review and evaluation of options and approaches for data citation
* Understanding the requirements for citing large-scale network models of disease and compound research obejcts
* Demonstration of a citation-enabled workflow using a linked data approach
* Benefits mapping using the KRDS2 taxonomy
* Technical and policy implications of citation by leading publishers
* Dissemination across communities (bio-informatics and research and information communities)
