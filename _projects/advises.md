#ADVISES

[ADVISES](http://www.allhands.org.uk/2007/proceedings/papers/818.pdf) (Adaptive Visualisation for epidemiological E-Science) was an [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/)
funded project to “create a new way of communicating with computers for scientists”.
This project was influenced by the experience of [UTOPIA](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/rich-clients/utopia/).

The principal investigator was [Professor Sutcliffe](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) of the University of Manchester. The project ran from August 2006 to August 2009.
