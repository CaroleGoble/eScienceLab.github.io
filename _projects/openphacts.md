#Open PHACTS

The [Open PHACTS](http://www.openphacts.org) Discovery Platform has been developed to reduce barriers to drug discovery in industry, academia and for small businesses. It contains various data sources, integrated and linked together so that the relationships between compounds, targets, pathways, diseases, tissues and publications can be easily found. Data sources include ChEBI, ChEMBL, ChemSpider, ConceptWiki, DisGeNET, DrugBank, Gene Ontology, neXtProt, UniProt and WikiPathways.
