Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make
scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching
them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive
workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and
task automation. The [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/index.html) was created in
October 2014 to act as a governing body for the project.
