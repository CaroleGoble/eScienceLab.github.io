[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org) is a sibling initiative inspired by the [Software Carpentry](/activities/software-carpentry), designed to teach researchers fundamental concepts, skills and tools for working
more effectively with data. Both initiatives maintain close ties which helps to build a community of practice among the instructors and expand the base of teaching materials. As in Software Carpentry, teaching is delivered through intensive two-day workshops.

Data Carpentry designs the workshops to fit into the needs of particular domains, but covers core topics such as:

* caveats of working with spreadsheets,
* data manipulation and visualisation with R or Python,
* introduction to SQL, and
* introduction to Open Refine.

We support the Data Carpentry mission through our work for the [Software Sustainability Institute](/projects/ssi), which is the official Data Carpentry representative in the UK.
