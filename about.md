The [eScience Lab](/) research group is led by [Professor Carole Goble](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Carole.goble/). The group is based at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/),  [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk). It's affiliated with the wider [Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/).

The [eScience Lab team](/people/) are focused on research and development around a set of tools designed for data driven and computational research. The tools support the coming together of people, data and methods in a particular research area; this is also know as an _e-laboratory_. These e-Laboratories or _e-Labs_ support domains as diverse as systems biology, social science, music, astronomy, multimedia and chemistry. The [tools](/products/) have been adopted by a large number of projects and institutions.

Our [research](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) span a wide array of topics, including eScience, bioinformatics, biodiversity, scholarly communication, reproducible science, linked data, provenance, community building and knowledge representation.

The eScience Lab currently has guaranteed funding until 2020.

## History

In 2001, the [myGrid consortium](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/about-us/) was formed,
bringing together collaborators at the Universities of Manchester, Southampton, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield, The European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute ([EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/)) in Cambridge, and industrial partners GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, Sun Microsystems, IBM, GeneticXchange, Epistemics and Cerebra (formerly Network Inference). The UK [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/) funded the first phase of the project with £3.5 million.

In phase 2, from 2006 to 2009, the consortium was funded for £2 million as part of the Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute ([OMII-UK](http://www.omii.ac.uk/)) funded by EPSRC  ([EP/D076617/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/D076617/1)), in addition to an EPSRC platform grant ([EP/C536444/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/C536444/1)). The membership of the consortium was concentrated at the University of Manchester and EMBL-EBI.

In phase 3, from 2009 to 2014, the team was funded for £1.15 million by a grant from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([EP/G026238/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G026238/1)).  The membership of the consortium for Phase 3 was the University of Manchester and the University of Southampton.

The _myGrid team_ continued as a
sub-group of the
Information Management Group
at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), participating in [multiple projects](/projects/). In 2015
the team formed the **eScience Lab** as a research group
at the school. The group remains associated with the
[Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/).
