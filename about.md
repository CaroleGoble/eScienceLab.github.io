  The eScience Lab team has produced and continue to develop a suite of tools designed to
  “help e-Scientists get on with science and get on with scientists”.
  The tools support the creation of e-laboratories and have been used in domains as
  diverse as systems biology, social science, music, astronomy, multimedia and chemistry.
  The tools have been adopted by a large number of projects and institutions.

The eScience Lab team has guaranteed funding until 2016.
