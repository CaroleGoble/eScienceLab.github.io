The Explorer provides an intuitive way to query the multiple data sources integrated in the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform. During the integration process, chemistry is validated and identifiers mapped. Development of the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform is driven by scientific use-cases and is tested by a community of industrial and academic users.
