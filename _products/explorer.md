The [Open PHACTS Explorer](https://explorer.openphacts.org) provides an intuitive way to query the multiple pharmacological and physicochemical data sources integrated in the [Open PHACTS Discovery Platform](https://www.openphacts.org/). 

During the integration process, chemistry is validated and identifiers mapped. Development of the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform is driven by scientific use-cases and is tested by a community of industrial and academic users.
