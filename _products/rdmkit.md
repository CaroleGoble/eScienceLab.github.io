[RDMKit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle. RDMkit supports FAIR data — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable — by-design, from the first steps of data management planning to the final steps of depositing data in public archives.
