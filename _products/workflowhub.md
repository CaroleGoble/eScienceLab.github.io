WorkflowHub is an evolution of myExperiment, a workflow system-agnostic registry of scientific workflows. 
It follows an open-development model, with regular community meetings held to steer the project's direction

In accordance with FAIR principles, WorkflowHub makes extensive use of open standards and tools such as [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/), [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), [BioSchemas](https://bioschemas.org/), 
[TRS](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/) in order to facilitate discovery and re-use of workflows in an accessible and interoperable way.

WorkflowHub is written in Ruby on Rails, and is based on the [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/products/seek) codebase.

WorkflowHub's development is part of [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/), funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement [824087](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824087).
