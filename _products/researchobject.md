Research Objects is an emerging approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web.

Research Objects aim to improve reuse and reproducibility by:

* Supporting the publication of **more than just PDFs**, making **data**, **code**, and other resources **first class citizens of scholarship**
* Recognizing that there is often a need to publish collections of these resources together as one shareable, cite-able resource.
* **Enriching** these resources and collections with any and all additional information required to make research reusable, and reproducible!
