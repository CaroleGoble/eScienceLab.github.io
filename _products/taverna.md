[Apache Taverna (incubating)](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/)  is powerful,
scalable, open source & domain independent Workflow Management System written in
Java – a suite of tools used to
design and execute scientific workflows and aid *in silico* experimentation comprising:

 *  **Workbench** (desktop client application)
 *  **Command Line Tool** (for a quick execution of workflows from a terminal)
 *  **Server** (for remote execution of workflows)
 *  **Player** (Web interface plugin for submitting workflows for remote execution written in Ruby on Rails)
 *  **Taverna Online** (for creation of Taverna workflows from a Web browser)

### Top features

 * Access to local tools/scripts and remote resources and analysis tools, Web and grid services
 * Not restricted to predetermined services – rapid incorporation of new services  without  coding
 * R support
 * Excel and csv spreadsheet support
 * Interaction with a running workflow from your Web browser
 * Creating and sharing workflow fragments as reusable components
 * Standards-compliant workflow run provenance collection


_Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at
[The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org/) sponsored by the
[Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/). Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF._
