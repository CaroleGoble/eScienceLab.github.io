The BioCatalogue is a registry of biological Web Services. It provides an open platform for biological Web Services registration, annotation and monitoring.


#### Our Goals:


- Provide a single registration point for Web Service providers and a single search site for scientists and developers.
- Provide a curated catalogue of life science web services
- Providers, Expert curators and Users will provide oversight, monitor the catalogue and provide high quality annotations for services.
- BioCatalogue as a place where the community can find, contact and meet the experts and maintainers of these services.
